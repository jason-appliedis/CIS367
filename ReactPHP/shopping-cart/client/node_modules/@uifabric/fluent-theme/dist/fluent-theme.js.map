This is the only work that occurs in the main\n *    thread.\n *\n *  - We normalize and de-duplicate events to account for browser quirks.

If a work-in-progress render is discarded before finishing,\n// we create a new work-in-progress by cloning the current queue.\n//\n// Both queues share a persistent, singly-linked list structure. To schedule an\n// update, we append it to the end of both queues. Each queue maintains a\n// pointer to first update in the persistent list that hasn't been processed.\n// The work-in-progress pointer always has a position equal to or greater than\n// the current queue, since we always work on that one. The current queue's\n// pointer is only updated during the commit phase, when we swap in the\n// work-in-progress.\n//\n// For example:\n//\n//   Current pointer:           A - B - C - D - E - F\n//   Work-in-progress pointer:              D - E - F\n//                                          ^\n//                                          The work-in-progress queue has\n//                                          processed more updates than current.\n//\n// The reason we append to both queues is because otherwise we might drop\n// updates without ever processing them. For example, if we only add updates to\n// the work-in-progress queue, some updates could be lost whenever a work-in\n// -progress render restarts by cloning from current. Similarly, if we only add\n// updates to the current queue, the updates will be lost whenever an already\n// in-progress queue commits and swaps with the current queue. However, by\n// adding to both queues, we guarantee that the update will be part of the next\n// work-in-progress. (And because the work-in-progress queue becomes the\n// current queue once it commits, there's no danger of applying the same\n// update twice.)\n//\n// Prioritization\n// --------------\n//\n// Updates are not sorted by priority, but by insertion; new updates are always\n// appended to the end of the list.\n//\n// The priority is still important, though. When processing the update queue\n// during the render phase, only the updates with sufficient priority are\n// included in the result. If we skip an update because it has insufficient\n// priority, it remains in the queue to be processed later, during a lower\n// priority render. Crucially, all updates subsequent to a skipped update also\n// remain in the queue *regardless of their priority*. That means high priority\n// updates are sometimes processed twice, at two separate priorities.

Intermediate state may vary according to system\n// resources, but the final state is always the same.\n\nvar UpdateState = 0;\nvar ReplaceState = 1;\nvar ForceUpdate = 2;\nvar CaptureUpdate = 3;\n\n// Global state that is reset at the beginning of calling `processUpdateQueue`.\n// It should only be read right after calling `processUpdateQueue`, via\n// `checkHasForceUpdateAfterProcessing`.\nvar hasForceUpdate = false;\n\nvar didWarnUpdateInsideUpdate = void 0;\nvar currentlyProcessingQueue = void 0;\nvar resetCurrentlyProcessingQueue = void 0;\n{\n  didWarnUpdateInsideUpdate = false;\n  currentlyProcessingQueue = null;\n  resetCurrentlyProcessingQueue = function () {\n    currentlyProcessingQueue = null;\n  };\n}\n\nfunction createUpdateQueue(baseState) {\n  var queue = {\n    baseState: baseState,\n    firstUpdate: null,\n    lastUpdate: null,\n    firstCapturedUpdate: null,\n    lastCapturedUpdate: null,\n    firstEffect: null,\n    lastEffect: null,\n    firstCapturedEffect: null,\n    lastCapturedEffect: null\n  };\n  return queue;\n}\n\nfunction cloneUpdateQueue(currentQueue) {\n  var queue = {\n    baseState: currentQueue.baseState,\n    firstUpdate: currentQueue.firstUpdate,\n    lastUpdate: currentQueue.lastUpdate,\n\n    // TODO: With resuming, if we bail out and resuse the child tree, we should\n    // keep these effects.\n    firstCapturedUpdate: null,\n    lastCapturedUpdate: null,\n\n    firstEffect: null,\n    lastEffect: null,\n\n    firstCapturedEffect: null,\n    lastCapturedEffect: null\n  };\n  return queue;\n}\n\nfunction createUpdate(expirationTime) {\n  return {\n    expirationTime: expirationTime,\n\n    tag: UpdateState,\n    payload: null,\n    callback: null,\n\n    next: null,\n    nextEffect: null\n  };\n}\n\nfunction appendUpdateToQueue(queue, update) {\n  // Append the update to the end of the list.\n  if (queue.lastUpdate === null) {\n    // Queue is empty\n    queue.firstUpdate = queue.lastUpdate = update;\n  } else {\n    queue.lastUpdate.next = update;\n    queue.lastUpdate = update;\n  }\n}\n\nfunction enqueueUpdate(fiber, update) {\n  // Update queues are created lazily.\n  var alternate = fiber.alternate;\n  var queue1 = void 0;\n  var queue2 = void 0;\n  if (alternate === null) {\n    // There's only one fiber.\n    queue1 = fiber.updateQueue;\n    queue2 = null;\n    if (queue1 === null) {\n      queue1 = fiber.updateQueue = createUpdateQueue(fiber.memoizedState);\n    }\n  } else {\n    // There are two owners.\n    queue1 = fiber.updateQueue;\n    queue2 = alternate.updateQueue;\n    if (queue1 === null) {\n      if (queue2 === null) {\n        // Neither fiber has an update queue.

Each page's item count is determined by the getItemCountForPage callback\n * if provided by the caller, or 10 as default. Each page's height is determined by the getPageHeight callback if\n * provided by the caller, or by cached measurements if available, or by a running average, or a default fallback.\n *\n * The algorithm for rendering pages works like this:\n *\n * 1. Predict visible pages based on \"current measure data\" (page heights, surface position, visible window)\n * 2. If changes are necessary, apply changes (add/remove pages)\n * 3. For pages that are added, measure the page heights if we need to using getBoundingClientRect\n * 4. If measurements don't match predictions, update measure data and goto step 1 asynchronously\n *\n * Measuring too frequently can pull performance down significantly. To compensate, we cache measured values so that\n * we can avoid re-measuring during operations that should not alter heights, like scrolling.\n *\n * To optimize glass rendering performance, onShouldVirtualize can be set. When onShouldVirtualize return false,\n * List will run in fast mode (not virtualized) to render all items without any measurements to improve page load time.\n * And we start doing measurements and rendering in virtualized mode when items grows larger than this threshold.\n *\n * However, certain operations can make measure data stale. For example, resizing the list, or passing in new props,\n * or forcing an update change cause pages to shrink/grow. When these operations occur, we increment a measureVersion\n * number, which we associate with cached measurements and use to determine if a remeasure should occur.\n */\nexport class List<T = any> extends React.Component<IListProps<T>, IListState<T>> implements IList {\n  public static defaultProps = {\n    startIndex: 0,\n    onRenderCell: (item: any, index: number, containsFocus: boolean) => <>{(item && item.name) || ''}</>,\n    renderedWindowsAhead: DEFAULT_RENDERED_WINDOWS_AHEAD,\n    renderedWindowsBehind: DEFAULT_RENDERED_WINDOWS_BEHIND,\n  };\n\n  public refs: {\n    [key: string]: React.ReactInstance;\n  };\n\n  private _root = React.createRef<HTMLDivElement>();\n  private _surface = React.createRef<HTMLDivElement>();\n  private _async: Async;\n  private _events: EventGroup;\n  private _estimatedPageHeight: number;\n  private _totalEstimates: number;\n  private _cachedPageHeights: {\n    [key: string]: {\n      height: number;\n      measureVersion: number;\n    };\n  };\n  private _focusedIndex: number;\n  private _scrollElement: HTMLElement;\n  private _hasCompletedFirstRender: boolean;\n\n  // surface rect relative to window\n  private _surfaceRect: IRectangle | undefined;\n\n  // The visible rect that we're required to render given the current list state.\n  private _requiredRect: IRectangle | null;\n\n  // The visible rect that we're allowed to keep rendered.
